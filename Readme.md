Design an in-memory key-value store like Redis

- The key-value store will be in-memory and does not require access to the file system.
- The key will always be a string.
- The value would be an object/map. The object would have attributes and
corresponding values.
Example => "sde_bootcamp": { "title": "sde-bootcamp", "price": 30000.00, "enrolled": false, "estimated_time": 30}
- Each attribute key would be a string and the attribute values could be string, integer, double or boolean.
- The key-value store should be thread-safe.
- The Key-Value store should expose the following functions:
  - get(String key) => Should return the value (object with attributes and their values). Return null if key not present
  - search(String attributeKey, String attributeValue) => Returns a list of keys that have the given attribute key, value pair.
  - put(String key, List<Pair<String, Object>> listOfAttributePairs) => Adds the key and the attributes to the key-value store. If the attribute key already exists then the attribute value is replaced.
  - delete(String key) => Deletes the key, value pair from the store.
  - keys() => Return a list of all the keys in a specific order.
- The value object should override the toString method to print the object as a
    comma-separated list of key-value pairs for the attributes.
    Example: attribute1: attribute_value_1, attribute2: attribute_value_2, attribute3: attribute_value_3 
- The data type of an attribute should get fixed after its first occurrence. Example: Once we encounter an attribute age with an integer value then any entry with an age attribute having a non-integer value should result in an exception.
- Nothing should be printed inside any of these methods. All scanning and printing should happen in the Driver/Main class only. Exception Handling should also happen in the Driver/Main class.
